Velocity & Capacity Planning
Velocity Calculation
Historical Velocity (assumed from similar projects): 45 story points per sprint
Calculation:
Sprint 1: 42 points (ramping up)
Sprint 2-5: 45-47 points (full velocity)
Sprint 6: 46 points (hardening)
Average Velocity: 45 story points/sprint
Capacity Planning
Team Capacity per Sprint:
Total Team Members: 8
Time Commitment: 40 hours/week
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Total Available Hours: 8 × 40 × 2 = 640 hours/sprint
Adjusted for Overhead:
Meetings (10%): 64 hours
Code review (10%): 64 hours
Unplanned work (10%): 64 hours
Net Capacity: 448 hours/sprint
Story Point to Hours Conversion:
45 story points ÷ 448 hours = 0.1 story points per hour
Or 10 hours per story point
Capacity Validation
Total Project Story Points: 270
Total Sprints: 6
Average per Sprint: 45 story points
Capacity: 448 hours = 44.8 story points (✓ Validated)

Risk Response Strategies
1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
Avoidance: Use audited OpenZeppelin contracts
Minimization: Internal code review, automated testing (Slither, Mythril)
Contingency: Emergency pause function, upgrade mechanism
Budget: $50K for external audit
2. AI Transaction Errors
Avoidance: Implement transaction preview and confirmation
Minimization: Set transaction limits, require explicit approval for >$1K
Contingency: Transaction reversal mechanism where possible, insurance fund
Testing: Extensive prompt injection testing, adversarial AI testing
3. Key Management Breach
Avoidance: Never store private keys on servers
Minimization: Client-side encryption, biometric authentication
Contingency: Multi-factor recovery, social recovery options
Compliance: SOC 2 Type II certification path
4. Network Congestion
Avoidance: EIP-1559 dynamic gas pricing
Minimization: Transaction batching, Layer 2 solutions
Contingency: Queue system, user notifications of delays
5. Third-Party Dependencies
Avoidance: Self-hosted blockchain nodes for critical paths
Minimization: Multiple provider fallbacks (Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode)
Contingency: Graceful degradation, cached data
6. Regulatory Compliance
Avoidance: Legal review of features before development
Minimization: Optional KYC/AML integration ready
Contingency: Geo-blocking capability, compliance mode
7. Scope Creep
Avoidance: Frozen requirements after sprint planning
Minimization: Change request process, stakeholder sign-off required
Contingency: Phase 2 parking lot for deferred features
